This project implements the combination of Redis and Python to store, and visualize performance data to track on them. 
Using Redis as a database management system, i extracted daily sales prices from a home property sales dataset, then aggregated and stored them in Redis. 
Then i calculate daily, monthly and yearly revenue from the stored data, which provides a clear view of financial performance over different times. 
I have created a web application that makes it easy to understand revenue trends and variations over time. 
This project demonstrates how to combine the fast storage and data processing features of Redis with the computation and visualization capabilities of Python for efficient analysis.
